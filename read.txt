Fix Tools

=> so if you want to create seperate tools category, than create seperate file in dbTool folder and add tools array in that file and than import that array in
 same folder index.js file and than spread that array file in Data array eg : data = [aiTools,...textTools];
 
=> Note every tools should have unique number id i.e  {id:5000} and shuld have same category eg ('Text Tools'). otherwise tool will be not displayed on seperate category page

=> The new pages remove _spaces , extract, email_extractor should have a unique number id and their category should be 'TextTools'

=> ip locator and site map generator tools should be in array of  seoTools.js file in dbTool folder, which i have created for you , just put your tools in that array and make sure that
they should have unique id and , i have exported that array in index.js of dbTool folder file and spread that in data file array
